# GiphTastic

A simple application that finds gif images and displays them.

## Description

This is a pretty simple application I developed to experiment with connecting to an API using basic JavaScript.

## Instructions

To use this application, you clone this repository and then open the index.html file in your browser.

Make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed before you try cloning the repo.

```
// ssh
git clone git@github.com:RexStrider/GiphTastic.git
// or
// https
git clone https://github.com/RexStrider/GiphTastic.git
```

Good luck!
